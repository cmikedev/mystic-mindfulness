#### The Blog

The Mystic Mindfulness website contains a blog with posts written by the site admin. The purpose of the blog is twofold. Firstly, to provide education and guidance to any visitors who may be unsure of what crystals to purchase. By providing such a visitor with guidance they will be more sure of their needs and more likely to make a purchase. Secondly, by extolling the benefits of the crystals within the post topic, the blog itself becomes a marketing tool to drive up sales from visitors.

## 3. Design

Font-Family used was Bilbo. LOTR is a recognisable cultural reference and reinforces mystical/fantastical element of the site. Hope is that the font will create that connection in users head.

Design - background to be somewhat ethereal/cosmic. 

Large use of white colours to denote health, emptiness, clean-living. No clutter.


W3C HTML:

Form error - thinks there's 2 id's but the widget replaces the old image with the new. So the old image is given an id and the new image's actual id is put in instead. When converted to HTML on the page it looks like there's 2 id's included.
